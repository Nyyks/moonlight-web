/**
 * @brief Holds this instance's line to the rendezvous server.
 *
 * What it is for
 * --------------
 * An instance used to be reachable because it published an A record pointing at
 * a home IP address. It no longer does. What makes it reachable now is this:
 * one outbound WebSocket, held open, over which the rendezvous server can reach
 * it at any moment. The line IS the reachability — there is nothing to publish
 * and nothing to poll.
 *
 * The reason it has to be a held connection rather than a periodic announcement
 * is that the address a browser actually needs — the reflexive candidate — is a
 * port that only exists while a connection is being made. It cannot be stored
 * and it cannot be re-used, so there is nothing an instance could usefully
 * announce in advance.
 *
 * What crosses it
 * ---------------
 * WebRTC signalling, and nothing else. No media, no input, no credentials. The
 * payloads are opaque to the server, which copies them between this line and
 * the browser that asked for this instance by identifier.
 *
 * Reaching the server
 * -------------------
 * The line is not opened by name. The name is resolved, its addresses are
 * raced (AddressRace), and the line is opened on the one that answered first,
 * carrying the name where the server and the certificate expect it. An IPv6
 * that silently drops packets then costs a quarter of a second instead of the
 * 21 to 30 s Qt spends on it before trying the IPv4. Each attempt, from
 * openLine() to connected, is bounded by an open timeout: past it the attempt
 * counts as a failure like a refusal would, and the family that had won the
 * race is not the one to lead with next time.
 *
 * Threading: Qt main thread only, like the rest of the network layer.
