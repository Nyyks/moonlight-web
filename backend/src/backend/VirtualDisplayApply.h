/**
 * @brief The `--vdisplay-apply` mode: the part of adding a virtual display
 * that needs rights the server does not have.
 *
 * Started by the elevated scheduled task (stage "all"), by the SYSTEM service
 * as one child per stage (the desktop halves in the console session, the
 * node half as SYSTEM), or by a hand-elevated instance. It reads
 * request.json from the staging directory, does exactly what that says,
 * writes result.json and prints the same JSON line on stdout. Never a
 * window, never a message box: the task runs hidden on a desktop that may
 * have no monitor at all.
 *
 * Stage "snapshot" (any desktop process, Activate only, first): save the
 *   active display layout — paths and modes — to topology.bin.
 * Stage "driver" (elevated):
 *   install    — re-hash the three driver files against the constants
 *                compiled in here, write the driver's settings XML if there
 *                is none, trust the catalog's signer for the duration, create
 *                the Root\MttVDD node named "MoonlightWeb Virtual Display"
 *                and install the package on it (SetupAPI + newdev), untrust
 *                again, leave the node disabled.
 *   uninstall  — remove our node; delete the package from the driver store
 *                only if no other node uses it.
 *   activate   — enable our node.
 *   deactivate — disable it.
 * Stage "mode" (any desktop process):
 *   activate   — wait for the virtual display to appear, switch off what
 *                Windows switched on with it, set 1080p at 120 Hz SDR, make
 *                it primary.
 *   deactivate — before the node goes: the saved layout back (or, without
 *                one, the previous primary back in its role).
