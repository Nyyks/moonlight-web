"""The stream's gate replayed on a pass's captures (plan « attente », 09/10/2026).

The native host encodes only the presents its gate admits
(backend/native-host/src/core/FrameCadence.h): the first present in each
tick's window of the stream's grid, from a quarter of an interval before the
tick to a quarter before the next. A window with nothing in it moves the grid
to the present that ends the gap; two, and the grid restarts on it.
This replays that gate, offline, on the captures a pass recorded, at any
stream rate and display rate, and says what the stream would have carried.

⚠️ Gate below is a COPY of FrameCadence::admit() (and of ceiling(), for a
stream at or above the display's rate): the nanosecond grid, kSlackDivisor 4,
kCeilingHeadroom 50, the windows, a ceiling's re-anchor past one display
period. Change it with the class. --before is the gate of the passes of 08-09/10
(re-anchored on any present later than one display period); checked on
09/10/2026, on every pass of benches 2 and c1 it gives the host's own "N not
carried" count to within 2 (7731 for 7733).

What it needs: a pass run with clicktrace=1 in MW_NATIVE_TUNING, whose capture
wake-ups were copied as bench-out/content-age/<tag>.click-trace.csv (see the
README). Traces of 08-09/10/2026 there:
  *-re9-vis-*      RE9 alone, ~77 pictures a second, virtual display at 120
                   and 240 Hz (<tag>.re9.txt bounds the game's scene)
  *-aw21-*         mw-click-target at 240 fps, virtual display at 120 / 240 Hz
  *-aw2c-*, *-aw2s-*  the same at 240 Hz, the stream at 120 or 240 fps

    python gatesim.py <tag> [<tag>...] [--fps 60] [--hz 240] [--before | --advance]

--fps / --hz: the stream's rate and the display's (default: both from the
pass's log). --before: the gate until the fix of 09/10/2026 (Cadence session),
for a pass recorded with it. --advance: the change the Android TV bench
proposed (B, 08/10/2026), a present later than one display period moving the
grid on by whole intervals from the tick it missed; it gives the rate back but
lets a game at the stream's rate beat against the grid. Per pass: the new pictures,
those the gate skipped, how long a skipped picture's change waited for the
next admitted one, and that wait averaged over every instant (what a click at
a random moment pays for the gate).

--inputadmit T[,B,R,S,K] (plan « inputadmit », 13/10/2026): the admission
window after a press on top of the gate, replayed on the pass's own presses
(the trace's `press` rows). T in ms, B windows ahead, R windows a second, S the
least gap in ms between two admitted pictures, K the most pictures a window
adds (0: as many presents as the display makes in T); B, R, S and K default to
3, 2, 0 and 3, the host's own defaults.
Its class, InputAdmit, is a COPY of core/InputAdmit.h, like Gate's. The
variants and what they cost the client: inputsim.py.

--lock (plan « glissade », 14/10/2026): the gate locked on the display's
presents. A Lattice (a COPY of core/PresentLattice.h) follows the presents'
own times; while it is engaged and the stream's interval is N >= 2 display
periods, the gate decides on each present's own time and keeps the start of
its windows halfway between two presents of the lattice. The lattice's period
is the host's, from its end-of-session line "cadence lock: period <ns> ns,
interval <ns> ns", else --period-ns, else 1e9 / the display's rate. A pointer
alone goes through the gate too when the pass drew the pointer into the
picture (--pointers). The table per family of passes, today against the lock:
locksim.py.

--interval-ns: the exact interval of a cadence aligned on a client that paints
on its vsync (CadenceAlign.h), which the log says only in that same line.

--selftest: the golden train, a synthetic pass of known presents run through
the locked gate, whose counts the C++ tests (test_cadence_lock.cpp) hold too.
