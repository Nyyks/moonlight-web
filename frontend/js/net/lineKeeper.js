/**
 * Keeps the page on its machine when the line to it drops.
 *
 * Through the rendezvous every request the application makes rides one data
 * channel, and that channel does not survive a phone putting the browser aside.
 * iOS suspends Chrome a couple of seconds after it leaves the screen — going to
 * the home screen is enough — and the connection is gone when it comes back.
 * Going back through the entry page then cost a whole start: the loading
 * screen, the handshake, the interface rebuilt from nothing, where the user
 * expected the page they had left.
 *
 * So the line is dialled again from here, under the page: same machine, same
 * pairing key, and the same cookie jar — the transport keeps it in storage, not
 * in the line — so the session the old line carried is the one the new line
 * carries. Requests made in the meantime wait for it instead of failing.
 *
 * The entry page stays the answer when no new line comes within
 * REDIAL_BUDGET_MS of the page being back in front, or after REDIAL_ATTEMPTS
 * failures. The entry page says what is happening and keeps trying, where this
 * page has nothing on screen to say it with.
 *
 * Under a stream it is not the answer. Going there ends the stream, and the
 * stream does not need the line: its own connection goes straight between the
 * two machines, and its signalling socket is closed on purpose once that
 * connection is up. So the line is dialled again behind the stream, for as
 * long as the stream lasts, and the page says so — `notice` — once it has been
 * away NOTICE_DELAY_MS: reconnecting, then, after the first budget, out of
 * reach, with one attempt every STREAM_REDIAL_EVERY_MS. Requests made while it
 * is out of reach fail at once rather than wait for it. A stream that ends with
 * the line still down goes to the entry page, as before.
 *
 * Nothing is dialled while the page is hidden. A suspended page cannot finish a
 * handshake, and one started in the seconds before the suspension would be found
 * half done on return, holding every request until its own deadline.
